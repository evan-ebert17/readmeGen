# readmeGen
## Function
This program is purely a node program, it uses inquire to run prompts in the command line to prompt the user for input to fill out a custom README template.
## Code
The way that this is written is delegated to two files, the index.js which is where all of the prompts are created and ran, and then the generateMarkdown.js which is where it takes all the user input from the index and puts it into the template literals which generate a README.
